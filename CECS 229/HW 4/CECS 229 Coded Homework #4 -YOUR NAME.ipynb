    "#### Task 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "Yours truly likes to listen to a band called \"Alt-J\".  Take a look at the music video for their song, \"Matilda\" at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q06wFUi5OM8.  The faces you see morphing into one another are the faces of the four members who were in the band at the time.  In this exercise you will explore how a simplified version of this \"morphing effect\" can be achieved.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Background:***\n",
    "\n",
    "First, keep in mind that a video is just a collection of several still images displayed with a speed fast enough to make the change from one image to another imperceptible to the human eye.  \n",
    "\n",
    "To make the discussion simpler, suppose the images are grayscale pictures.  We can represent a grayscale picture with $m \\times n$ pixels as a matrix $M \\in \\mathbb{R}_{m\\times n}$.  Each entry $m_{ij}$ of the matrix $M$ is the intensity value of the pixel at location $(i, j)$, [* The intensity values range from 0 (black) to 255 (white) *].  In the written homework problem set for vectors and vector spaces, you proved that $\\mathbb{R}_{m \\times n}$ is a vector space, hence given a set  $\\mathbb{I} \\subset \\mathbb{R}_{m \\times n}$ of two \"image-matrices\", we can form convex combinations of these two elements with the confidence that the resulting matrices will be in $\\mathbb{R}_{m \\times n}$. Let's express this a little more formally.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose $\\mathbb{I} = \\{I_i\\in \\mathbb{R}_{m\\times n} \\; | \\; i = 1, 2\\}$ is a set of 2 matrices and $\\alpha_1, \\alpha_2 \\in \\mathbb{R}$ such that $\\alpha_1 + \\alpha_2 = 1$.  Then, \n",
    "\n",
    "$\\hspace{10cm} I = \\alpha_1 \\; I_1 + \\alpha_2 \\; I_2 \\in \\mathbb{R}_{m \\times n}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Think: what would the image corresponding to matrix $I$ look like if $I = 0.5 I_1 + 0.5 I_2$?  Since the images $I_1$ and $I_2$ make an equal contribution to the intensity of each pixel in $I$, we can expect the image to look like an equal mix of the two images. e.g. if the two images contain faces in more-or-less the same position, the resulting image should display a face that more-or-less looks like both faces.  \n",
    "\n",
    "What if $I = 0.85 I_1 + 0.15 I_2$?  Then, since most of the intensity in each pixel of $I$ is being contributed by $I_1$, we can expect the resulting image $I$ to display something that looks more like the first image, $I_1$, vs the second image, $I_2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Your tasks***\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Download the `png` and `image` modules.  The `image` module contains the methods\n",
    " * `file2image()` - Reads an image into a list of lists of pixel values (triples with values representing the  three intensities in the RGB color channels). e.g. `[[(1, 2, 3), (1, 2, 3), (1, 2, 3)],[(1, 2, 3), (1, 2, 3), (1, 2, 3)],[(1, 2, 3), (1, 2, 3), (1, 2, 3)]]` would be representing an image with $3\\times3$ pixels.\n",
    " * `image2file()` - Writes an image in list of lists format to a file.\n",
    "2. Create the functions:\n",
    " * `png2graymatrix(filename)` - creates and returns a `Matrix` object with the image data returned by `file2image()` from the module `image`. The parameter `filename` is a string data type specifying the location of the image you wish to use.  If the image is not grayscale, you must convert it to grayscale prior to creating the `Matrix` object.  You can do so using the functions `isgray()` and `color2gray()`, also found in the `image` module.\n",
    " * `graymatrix2png(image_matrix, path)` - creates a png file out of a `Matrix` object.  You may want to use the function `image2file()` from the `image` module.\n",
    "2. Download and extract the zip folder `faces.zip`.  In it, you will find the images of 20 faces.  Use the functions from part 1. to create a program that generates a set of 101 images.  These images must be the result of taking convex combinations of two faces of your choice, so that one face appears to morph into the other.  To create the 100 different convex combinations, start by combining the two images so that the 1st/101 picture looks completely like the first face.  Then, modify the scalars of the combination so that the mixture of the faces is only a percentage of each face.  For example, the 2nd/101 picture would be a mixture of 99% of the first face mixed with 1% of the second face, the 51th/100 picture looks like both faces equally mixed together (50/50), the 76th picture looks like 25% of the first face mixed with 75% of the second picture, and the 101st/101 picture looks like the second face only. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Submit to the dropbox a screenshot of the 101 images your code produced.** \n",
